# Quick Image Edits

A collection of Python scripts for basic image manipulations. Each script focuses on a specific task:

1. **image_collager_batch.py**  
   Create collages from multiple images, supporting horizontal, vertical, and grid layouts.

2. **image_collager_two_imgs.py**  
   Quickly combine two images side-by-side or top-to-bottom.

3. **image_cropper_batch.py**  
   Batch-crop multiple images using a scrollable selection tool.

4. **image_matcher.py**  
   Select corresponding points on two images and compute a homography.

5. **image_masker.py**  
   Apply HSV-based color masking and optional manual pixel removal.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Install required Python dependencies (e.g., Pillow, OpenCV, Tkinter).  
3. Run each script directly via `python script_name.py` and follow on-screen instructions.
